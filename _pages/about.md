I am a undergraduate majoring in Computer Science at the CSE department, Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), Shenzhen, China.

During my senior year, I also had a wonderful time as a research intern supervised by Prof. [Sitao Huang](https://sitaohuang.com/) at [UC Irvine](https://uci.edu/) [CORSA Lab](https://corsa.eng.uci.edu/).

My research focuses on hardware accelerators, heterogeneous computing, and compilers. 

I am applying for Ph.D. programs for 2024 Fall. If you would like to learn more about my research or connect with me, please feel free to reach out via the contact information provided below.

Thank you for visiting my website!
