I am an undergraduate majoring in Computer Science at the [CSE](https://cse.sustech.edu.cn/en/) department, [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) (SUSTech), Shenzhen, China.

During my senior year, I also had a wonderful time as a research intern supervised by Prof. [Sitao Huang](https://sitaohuang.com/) at [UCï¼Œ Irvine](https://uci.edu/) [CORSA](https://corsa.eng.uci.edu/) Lab.

My research interests include hardware accelerators, system optimization for high performance algorithms, and high-level synthesis.

I am applying for Ph.D. programs for 2024 Fall. If you would like to learn more about my research or connect with me, please feel free to reach out via the contact information provided below.
