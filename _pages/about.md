I am Ziyao Yin, currently an M.S. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech. I previously received my B.Eng. in Computer Science from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) (SUSTech) in Shenzhen, China.

My interests include computer architecture, hardware accelerators, and chip verification and design. I have experience in accelerator development and optimization, architecture-level simulation, and building verification testbenches and regression flows. I am also familiar with the RTL-to-GDSII flow. I am currently seeking opportunities in the chip industry, including verification and design roles.
